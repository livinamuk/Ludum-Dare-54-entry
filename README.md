# Ludum Dare #54 hard mode entry - OpenGL first person shooter 

![](https://www.principiaprogrammatica.com/dump/vlcsnap.png)

First person shooter written in c++/OpenGL for Ludum Dare #54 compo hard mode. 48 hours to submit a game with all assets and code made from scratch by a single person. External libraries, personal frameworks, and content creators are allowed. 

I ripped a basic renderer with shadow mapping and camera movement out one of my other engines and then worked on top of that. Not much of a game to show for it but I did implement a lot of low level algorithms very quickly. I wish I‚Äôd had another few hours to polish the gameplay but skeletal animation and the cpu side vertex skinnning for the enemy hit detection ate the time. Streams are on this channel under live.

This is a reupload because I woke up and had to swap the scream audio. It was appalling and the rest I'm pretty proud of. There's also no music in the original submission version, just some eerie ambience. Download link is below.
